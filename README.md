# CRUD Operations
*Django* is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.<br> Django is based on MVT (Model View Template) architecture and revolves around CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. <br>
CRUD can be best explained as an approach to building a Django web application. In general CRUD means performing Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations on a table in a database.
